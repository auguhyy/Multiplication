# Multiplication

1.	Develop a web page that will plot to the screen the multiplication table up to 10X10. 
2. Add a tooltip to each cell, to show the exercise that it is the result of (i.e. 32 will show 8X4=32 in the tool tip) 
3. Add a URL parameter matrix_size (or GUI control) that selects the value (default =10) between 3 to 15 and refresh the page to show the relevant table. 
4. Add a URL parameter matrix_base (or GUI control) which has three options (decimal, binary, hex), so the user can decide in which format he will see the table. Once selected the table is refreshed with the relevant values. 
5. Color the background of the Prime numbers.
